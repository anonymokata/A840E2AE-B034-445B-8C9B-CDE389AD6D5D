# romanCalc

Roman numeral calculator featuring addition and subtraction. Run 'make' to build, and 'make check' to test.

The library's romanMath() function takes a single string of roman numerals. The library is case insensitive (upper or lowercase works fine), and can be formatted with or without quotes and whitespace.
